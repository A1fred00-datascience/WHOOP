# WHOOP Personal Health Analysis Project

## Overview
This project leverages data collected from a WHOOP device to perform a comprehensive analysis of personal health and wellness trends. By integrating and analyzing data on sleep patterns, workouts, journal entries, and physiological responses, the project aims to provide actionable insights into improving personal health outcomes.

## Data Description
The analysis is based on four primary datasets extracted from the WHOOP platform, covering journal entries, sleep analysis, workout logs, and physiological cycles. These datasets include metrics crucial for understanding overall wellness, such as sleep performance, recovery scores, and activity strain.

### Data Files:
- **Journal Entries:** Insights into daily habits and subjective wellness assessments.
- **Sleep:** Metrics on sleep quality, disturbances, and recovery.
- **Workouts:** Details on exercise types, duration, and intensity.
- **Physiological Cycles:** Data on heart rate variability, resting heart rate, and more.

## Project Objectives
- Integrate data from various sources into a cohesive analysis framework.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis to identify key health and wellness trends.
- Develop machine learning models to predict recovery scores based on lifestyle factors.
- Offer insights and recommendations for wellness improvement.

## Methodology
The project follows a structured approach, starting with data preprocessing and integration, followed by exploratory data analysis to uncover underlying patterns. Feature engineering identifies relevant predictors for machine learning models, which are then used to forecast recovery scores. The analysis concludes with an evaluation of feature importance to highlight the most influential factors on recovery.

## Results
The analysis provides a multi-faceted view of personal health, linking daily activities and physiological metrics to recovery outcomes. Machine learning models further enable the prediction of wellness scores, offering a scientific basis for personal health optimization.

## Technologies Used
- **Pandas & Numpy:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** For data visualization.
- **Scikit-learn:** For machine learning model development.

## Running the Project
